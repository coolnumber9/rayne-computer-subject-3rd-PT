		<h2>Believer (by Imagine Dragons)</h2>
		
		First things first<br>
		I'mma say all the words inside my head<br>
		I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh<br>
		The way that things have been, oh ooh<br>
		<br>
	
		Second things second<br>
		Don't you tell me what you think that I could be<br>
		I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh<br>
		The master of my sea, oh ooh<br>
		<br>
		
		I was broken from a young age<br>
		Taking my sulking to the masses<br>
		Writing my poems for the few<br>
		That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me<br>
		Singing from heartache from the pain<br>
		Taking my message from the veins<br>
		Speaking my lesson from the brain<br>
		Seeing the beauty through the...<br>
		<br>
		
		Pain!<br>
		You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
		Pain!<br>
		You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer<br>
		Pain!<br>
		Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br>
		My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br>
		Pain!<br>
		You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
		<br>
		
		Third things third<br>
		Send a prayer to the ones up above<br>
		All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh<br>
		Your spirit up above, oh ooh<br>
		<br>
	
		I was choking in the crowd<br>
		Building my rain up in the cloud<br>
		Falling like ashes to the ground<br>
		Hoping my feelings, they would drown<br>
		But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<br>
		Inhibited, limited<br>
		Till it broke open and rained down<br>
		And rained down, like...<br>
		<br>
		
		Pain!<br>
		You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
		Pain!<br>
		You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer<br>
		Pain!<br>
		Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br>
		My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br>
		Pain!<br>
		You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
		<br>
			
		Last things last<br>
		By the grace of the fire and the flames<br>
		You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh<br>
		The blood in my veins, oh ooh<br>
		But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<br>
		Inhibited, limited<br>
		Till it broke open and rained down<br>
		And rained down, like...<br>
		<br>
			
		Pain!<br>
		You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
		Pain!<br>
		You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer<br>
		Pain!<br>
		Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br>
		My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br>
		Pain!<br>
		You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
