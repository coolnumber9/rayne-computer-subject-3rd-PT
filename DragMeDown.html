		<h2>Drag Me Down (by One Direction)</h2>
		
		[Harry:]<br>
		I've got fire for a heart<br>
		I'm not scared of the dark<br>
		You've never seen it look so easy<br>
		I got a river for a soul<br>
		And baby you're a boat<br>
		Baby you're my only reason<br>
		<br>

		[Louis:]<br>
		If I didn't have you there would be nothing left<br>
		The shell of a man who could never be his best<br>
		If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun<br>
		You taught me how to be someone, yeah<br>
		<br>
		
		[Liam:]<br>
		All my life<br>
		You stood by me<br>
		When no one else was ever behind me<br>
		All these lights<br>
		They can't blind me<br>
		With your love, nobody can drag me down<br>
		<br>
		
		[Niall:]<br>
		All my life<br>
		You stood by me<br>
		When no one else was ever behind me<br>
		All these lights<br>
		They can't blind me<br>
		With your love, nobody can drag me down<br>
		<br>
		
		[Chorus:]<br>
		Nobody, nobody<br>
		Nobody can drag me down<br>
		Nobody, nobody<br>
		Nobody can drag me down<br>
		<br>
		
		[Niall:]<br>
		I got fire for a heart<br>
		I'm not scared of the dark<br>
		You've never seen it look so easy<br>
		I got a river for a soul<br>
		And baby you're a boat<br>
		Baby you're my only reason<br>
		<br>
		
		[Harry:]<br>
		If I didn't have you there would be nothing left (nothing left)<br>
		The shell of a man who could never be his best (be his best)<br>
		If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun (see the sun)<br>
		You taught me how to be someone<br>
		Yeah<br>

		[Niall:]<br>

		Nobody, nobody<br>
		Nobody can drag me down<br>
		Nobody, nobody<br>
		Nobody can drag me<br>

		Nobody, nobody<br>
		Nobody can drag me down<br>
		<br>
		
		Nobody, nobody<br>
		Nobody can drag me down<br>
		Nobody, nobody<br>
		Nobody can drag me down<br>
