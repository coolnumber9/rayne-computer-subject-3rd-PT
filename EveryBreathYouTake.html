		<h2>Every Breath You Take (by The Police)</h2>
		
		Every breath you take<br>
		Every move you make<br>
		Every bond you break<br>
		Every step you take<br>
		I'll be watching you.<br>
		<br>

		Every single day<br>
		Every word you say<br>
		Every game you play<br>
		Every night you stay<br>
		I'll be watching you.<br>
		<br>

		Oh can't you see<br>
		You belong to me?<br>
		How my poor heart aches with every step you take.<br>
		<br>

		Every move you make<br>
		Every vow you break<br>
		Every smile you fake<br>
		Every claim you stake<br>
		I'll be watching you.<br>
		<br>

		Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace.<br>
		I dream at night, I can only see your face.<br>
		I look around but it's you I can't replace.<br>
		I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace.<br>
		I keep crying baby, baby, please...<br>
		<br>

		Oh can't you see<br>
		You belong to me?<br>
		How my poor heart aches with every step you take.<br>
		<br>

		Every move you make<br>
		Every vow you break<br>
		Every smile you fake<br>
		Every claim you stake<br>
		I'll be watching you.<br>
		<br>

		Every move you make<br>
		Every step you take<br>
		I'll be watching you...<br>
		<br>

		I'll be watching you<br>
		<br>

		<br>

		Every single day<br>
		Every word you say<br>
