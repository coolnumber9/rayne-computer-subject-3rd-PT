		<h2>Havana (by Camila Cabello)</h2>
		
		Havana, ooh na-na (ay)<br>
		Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)<br>
		He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na<br>
		Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)<br>
		There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)<br>
		Havana, ooh na-na (uh)<br>
		<br>

		He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (uh)<br>
		(When he came in the room)<br>
		He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (uh)<br>
		(But I can't without you)<br>
		I knew him forever in a minute (hey)<br>
		(That summer night in June)<br>
		And papa says he got malo in him (uh)<br>
		He got me feelin' like<br>
		<br>

		Oooh... I knew it when I met him<br>
		I loved him when I left him<br>
		Got me feelin' like<br>
		Oooh... and then I had to tell him<br>
		I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na<br>
		<br>

		Havana, ooh na-na (ay, ay)<br>
		Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)<br>
		He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (uh huh)<br>
		Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)<br>
		My heart is in Havana (ay)<br>
		Havana, ooh na-na<br>
		<br>

		I knew I was there when I read the sign<br>
		(Welcome to La Yuma)<br>
		I knew it was him when he hugged from behind<br>
		(It gets me every time)<br>
		He's put in work, but it's in the streets<br>
		(He said, girl, can you ride?)<br>
		And this is the part that my daddy told me<br>
		He got me feelin' like<br>
		<br>

		Oooh... I knew it when I met him<br>
		I loved him when I left him<br>
		Got me feelin' like<br>
		Oooh... and then I had to tell him<br>
		I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na<br>
		<br>

		Havana, ooh na-na (ay, ay)<br>
		Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (oh, ay, ay)<br>
