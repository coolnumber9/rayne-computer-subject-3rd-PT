		<h2>One Day (by Matisyahu)</h2>
		
		Sometimes I lay<br>
		Under the moon<br>
		And thank God I'm breathing<br>
		Then I pray<br>
		Don't take me soon<br>
		'Cause I am here for a reason<br>
		<br>

		Sometimes in my tears I drown<br>
		But I never let it get me down<br>
		So when negativity surrounds<br>
		I know some day it'll all turn around because...<br>
		<br>
		
		All my life I've been waiting for<br>
		I've been praying for<br>
		For the people to say<br>
		That we don't wanna fight no more<br>
		There will be no more wars<br>
		And our children will play<br>
		One day [6x]<br>
		<br>

		It's not about<br>
		Win or lose<br>
		'Cause we all lose<br>
		When they feed on the souls of the innocent<br>
		Blood-drenched pavement<br>
		Keep on moving though the waters stay raging<br>
		<br>

		In this maze you can lose your way (your way)<br>
		It might drive you crazy but don't let it faze you, no way (no way)<br>
		<br>

		Sometimes in my tears I drown (I drown)<br>
		But I never let it get me down (get me down)<br>
		So when negativity surrounds (surrounds)<br>
		I know some day it'll all turn around because...<br>
		<br>

		All my life I've been waiting for<br>
		I've been praying for<br>
		For the people to say<br>
		That we don't wanna fight no more<br>
		There will be no more wars<br>
		And our children will play<br>
		One day [6x]<br>
		<br>

		One day this all will change<br>
		Treat people the same<br>
		Stop with the violence<br>
		Down with the hate<br>
		<br>

		One day we'll all be free<br>
		And proud to be<br>
		Under the same sun<br>
		Singing songs of freedom like<br>
		One day [4x]<br>
		<br>

		All my life I've been waiting for<br>
		I've been praying for<br>
		For the people to say<br>
		That we don't wanna fight no more<br>
		There will be no more wars<br>
		And our children will play<br>
		One day [6x]<br>
